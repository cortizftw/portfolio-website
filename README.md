### Portfolio Website Built Using HTML, CSS and Javascript

### Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive web application with distinct functionalities aimed at showcasing proficiency in web development technologies. The homepage will serve as the primary interface, demonstrating the application's utilization of HTML and CSS to create an engaging and visually appealing user experience. For user registration, a dedicated page will be implemented, integrating JavaScript validation to ensure data accuracy. Upon successful validation, users will seamlessly proceed to the login page; otherwise, an alert will prompt them to review and correct their input before reloading the page.

The login page will feature secure authentication mechanisms, verifying user credentials against static data comparisons. Users will be required to input their student ID as the username and their first name and last name as the password. Successful authentication will grant access to the homepage, while unsuccessful attempts will trigger an alert, prompting users to retry.

In addition to user functionality, the application will include informative sections such as 'About Us' and 'Contact Us.' The 'About Us' section will incorporate a canvas element, presenting interactive graphs to provide insights into the organization or project. On the other hand, the 'Contact Us' section will feature contact cards, allowing users to navigate to detailed candidate information pages upon selection. Through these features, the web application aims to demonstrate a holistic understanding of web development concepts and technologies.
